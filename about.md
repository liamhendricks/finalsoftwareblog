title: About

My name is Liam Hendricks, a software developer generalist with over a decade of professional
experience.

I like to consider myself a generalist because I have a variety of experiences and interests.
Professionally, I do mostly backend web dev. My work has taken me to big companies and small
companies alike, local and remote. Outside of work, I have spent years as a hobbyist game developer
with aspirations to release a full featured game someday. 

My current project is called [Summoning]({% link summoning.md %}). An open world action RPG with a retro art style created with
open source tools like the Godot game engine, Blender, Gimp, Audacity and - of course - the Linux
operating system. The project has over 40,000 lines of GDScript and C++ as of writing this! But, as a
(mostly) solo dev, I have had to develop skills beyond just programming. I do my own 3D modeling, texturing,
rigging and animating in Blender and my own sound design and mixing in Audacity.

Thanks for stopping by, here are some links...
