The Inar people are primarily residents of the continent of [Inaria](/wiki/inaria.md). I have 
imagined them as a kind of nomadic people like the Fremen from Dune. They do build civilizations and
engage in 'society', but many of them wander nomadically. They are dark skinned and often wear robes
to keep cool in the desert. They are known for their stealth and affinity towards various types of
magic.
