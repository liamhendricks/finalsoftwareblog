Northlanders are the primary inhabitants of [Anathia](/wiki/anathia). Aesthetically, they are white
european or scandinavian analogies. Despite that, they are actually a fairly wide ethnic group with
many different languages and dialects, but can primarily be understood as 'the white guys' of the
Nevermyst universe. They are good weapon fighters and have a long history of glorious victory in
battle, but many are skilled in magic as well.
