A philosophical / religious tradition of the [Anathian](/wiki/anathia) people. It is centered around
the worship of heroic figures of the past who have been officially named by Stigmanic Priests.

### Core beliefs:

Stigmanists believe that accomplishing heroic feats of strength, great sacrifices, or otherwise
impressive deeds is the purpose of life. They spend their days training physically, magically or
in any number of ways to be prepared for their 'Quintessence'. A moment that they believe each person
has, which will define them for eternity. This moment may come at any time, so it is essential for
them to ready.

The concept of sacrifice is possibly the most important. To sacrifice for a just cause is the highest
form of life. Many followers will perform ritual meditation ceremonies where they expose themselves 
to great pain, or torment so they can prepare for a noble sacrifice.

Followers of Stigmana choose to worship a single, or many 'stignamed' heros, often forming subsects
to strictly follow the teachings of that hero.

### Priests:

Stigmanic Priests are a class of followers elected to lead others in ritual Stigmana meditation.
These priests do not form any formal leadership of the Stigmana, because it is not a heirarchically
organized ideology. There is a conclave once every 5 years where various decisions are made. They
are not paid for their services, and are largely granted land or land use by a noble who either
tolerates their activities, or is a believer themself. Many choose a life of complete destitution.

### Followers:

Followers of Stigmana range from the ultra dedicated, to the passively participating. The average
Anathian will have some sort of hero they worship, but many simply see their particular chosen hero
as a good luck charm, or a role model. Not every follower will meditate or prepare obsessively for
their Quintessence, but true believers exist all around.
