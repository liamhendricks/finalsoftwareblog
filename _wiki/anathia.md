Anathia is primarily the home to a race of people known as [Northlanders](/wiki/northlanders). From
an aesthetic perspective, Anathian architecture, customs and culture follows an early middle-ages
formula. Some [towns](/wiki/towns) might appear more scandinavian inspired, some more gothic, etc
etc.

### Geography:

It's a continent surrounded by seas and contains mostly temperate forests with mountains, hills and
valleys. There are many cave entrances that lead to [The Chasmlurk](/wiki/chasmlurk), and portals
that lead to [The Gnostic Plane](/wiki/gnosticplane).
