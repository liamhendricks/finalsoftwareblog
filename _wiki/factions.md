The world of Nevermyst is home to many factions that the player can join.

## Anathia:

Factions who primarily exist on [Anathia](/wiki/anathia).

### Kingdom of Anath:

The Kingdom of Anath can largely be seen as the 'state' of Anath. It is ruled by 
[High King Evander Oloffson](/wiki/evander-oloffson), and it's capital is [Tyranoss](/wiki/tyranoss).
Politically The Kingdom of Anath is a feudal rulership system of patronage. There are several High
Dukes who have sworn fealty to the King. Through these vassal relationships, the Kingdom of Anath
has direct control over most of the continent. However, pockets of resistance do exist.

### Fenriz Brotherhood:

Formed 15 years ago from the remains of the defeated army of
[Ser Clayton Kesselring](/wiki/clayton-kesselring). Kesselring made a vain attempt to win the throne
of Anathia, but was slain in battle by King Oloffson. Many Anathians are sympathetic to Kesselring
and support his brother [Simon](/wiki/simon-kesselring).
