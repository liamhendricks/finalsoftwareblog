The Orcs are from the 3rd and thus far unnamed continent. In the Nevermyst universe, Orcs are adept
magic users, and not typically big, strong warriors as in other fantasy worlds. They prefer the
cultivation of knowledge and magical prowess to the swing of a sword. The orc aesthetic is a type of
celtic druidic vibe. Also known canonically as Gronalfar.
