Welcome to the world of Nevermyst. Here will be the ever-evolving lore of this world I have created
over the past few years. In many ways it is meant to be a basic fantasy setting with my own twists, 
but there are some unique and interesting ideas I've tried to cultivate. 

### The World of Nevermyst:

As of right now there are 3 main continents called [Anathia](/wiki/anathia), [Inaria](/wiki/inaria)
and another currently unnamed one. Also a few DnD inspired realms. One like the 'underdark' that I
have called [The Chasmlurk](/wiki/chasmlurk), and a kind of 'astral plane' I call [The Gnostic Plane](/wiki/gnosticplane). Canonically there could be more, but I can't make all 
that shit atm. The world contains many creatures and races of humanoids, and is full of magic.

### Inhabitants:

There are 4 main [races](/wiki/races), but canonically there could be more.
[Northlanders](/wiki/northlanders), [Inar](/wiki/inar), [Elves](/wiki/elves), [Orcs](/wiki/orcs).
Each race has it's own [Factions](/wiki/factions), [Towns](/wiki/towns) and
[Characters](/wiki/characters). 

### Creatures:

There are many familiar types of [creatures](/wiki/creatures) planned to exist in the game, such as
[Wolves](/wiki/wolf) , [Bears](/wiki/bear) and even [Dragons](/wiki/dragon). But many new inventions
that are inspired by other fantasy settings.

### Magic:

The magic system in the game is based around [spell schools](/wiki/spell-schools) that are typically
acquired by a person at birth. Those that do not have magic abilities are considered
[fallow](/wiki/fallow). [Character builds](/wiki/builds) have 3 primary skills, and the lore reason
for that is currently ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

### Divinity:

Personally, I think Gods in videogames can be really uninteresting, so divine beings are not a large
part of the lore. There is just one God in the world of Nevermyst and he's a real guy you can go
visit... if you can find him. He is called [Bastion](/wiki/bastion). Not much lore has been developed
on his behalf yet, but he is gonna be chilling in The Gnostic Plane sometimes as an omnipotent being.

### Stigmana and Stignames:

Because the divine God Bastion is essentially a corporeal being (however omnipotent he may be), most
denizens of Nevermyst do not worship him. Instead, there is a long tradition of worshipping heros of
the past as though they had become divine through their incredible deeds. This is a type of religion
known as [Stigmana](/wiki/stigmana). Those who have become legends, are given a 'stigname'. These
can be anything, but usually titles containing 'the' or 'of' such as,
'[Carl the Brave](/wiki/carl-the-brave)', 'Glaston the Wise', or 'Elfric of Innsmark' are reserved
for stignamed heroes. In this system of worship, only 1 hero gets to be 'the brave' or 'the wise', so
the hero is an extension of the language in some ways.
